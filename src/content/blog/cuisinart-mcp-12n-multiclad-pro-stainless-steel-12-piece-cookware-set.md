## Features of Cuisinart MCP-12n Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set

**Superior Tri-Ply Construction**

This cookware set is constructed using a unique 18/10 triple-ply technique that c**ombines a brushed stainless steel exterior, pure aluminum core, and stainless steel interior.**

While the exterior mirror finish gives it a sense of sophistication, the **aluminum core ensures even heat distribution and retention**. As such, you can be sure that you will never experience hot spots when using this cookware. 

Additionally, this cookware uses the **Heat Surround Technology** (layered construction)**,** which further improves heat distribution along both the bottom and the sides of the pans and pots.

**An Updated and Ergonomic Handle**

Cuisinart Multiclad regularly updates its cookware to improve functionality. The Cuisinart MCP-12n features well-designed handles to offer a firm grip, even when the pot is full. 

This cookware line has cool-grip handles with a stylish finish that oozes professionalism and ease of control. The ergonomic handles are secured with steel rivets for strength and top-notch functionality. 

**Heat Surround Technology**

The heat surround technology is an innovation to improve the efficacy of stainless steel cookware. 

When using this technology, the stainless steel pots and pans include aluminum cores. Unlike stainless steel, the aluminum base will heat and cool quickly, which gives you a precise temperature control ability. 

Additionally, the inner layer is made of high-quality stainless steel, while the outer one is made out of 18/10 stainless steel. This layered construction improves heat distribution along the bottom and the sides of the cookware. 

The construction makes the Cuisinart pans and pots ideal for simmering sauces, sauteing vegetables, boiling pasta, browning meat, among many other functions. The Heat Surround Technology makes this set highly versatile!

**Oven and Dishwasher Safe**

The Cuisinart MCP-12n Cookware Set is oven safe up to 550F. Additionally, you can wash all the pans, skillets, and pots in a dishwasher without compromising their efficacy and longevity. 

**Tight-Fitting Stainless Steel Covers**

The set has tight-fitting stainless steel covers that enable you to seal in food’s natural juices and flavors for a healthier and tastier meal. 

Additionally, the covers have a drip-free pouring rim, making them ideal for preparing soup. You’ll have an easy time emptying excess liquids from your meals. 

## What We Don’t Like About The Set

While Cuisinart MCP-12n Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set offered superb cooking experienced, there are several things that we did not like about it. They include:

**High Chance of Burning Your Food If You Don’t Season 1t**

There is a high chance that you will burn your food when using the set for the first time, resulting in a black surface. To avoid this, you should heat the pan slowly under low heat and add a little oil. Continue heating it until you can see a little smoke from the pan’s surface. This way, your pan will be seasoned, and you’ll have no problems using it henceforth. 

If you already have the blackened surface and you’re wondering how to clean it, then you can get a [**comprehensive guide on cleaning stainless steel cookware**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-pans//) here.

**Pans are not stackable.**

The pans are very hard to stack, which makes storage quite a nightmare. You will need enough storage space if you’re considering purchasing this set.

**It can be a bit noisy when cooking on high settings of an induction cooktop**

You’ll likely experience buzz sounds when you’re cooking on an induction cooktop. However, this is primarily common when using high heat settings.
