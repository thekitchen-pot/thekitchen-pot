If you have been considering getting a range hood, but you cannot vent it outdoors because of ductwork restrictions in your kitchen, then you might just have a new best friend: a ductless range
hood. Also called recirculating hoods or non-vented hoods, they work by pulling in air, filtering out the grease, smoke, and odors and returning the filtered air back into your kitchen. 

So, how do they really work?

Essentially, air is extracted into the hood by a fan located inside the hood. Think of the extraction process as similar to the fan you may have in your bathroom. The air passes through a **grease filter** (typically aluminum mesh or stainless steel baffles), that captures airborne particles of grease. The filtered air then continues through the **activated charcoal filters** that eliminate odors and smoke. Lastly, the filtered air is returned back to the kitchen space.

With ductless range hoods, there are no ducts. No outside venting. Just cleaner indoor air.

Sounds great, right?

But like any fantastic invention, it has its caveats. One major plus is **installation is very easy**. You can mount it on your wall, under a cabinet or on your ceiling if you want to get fancy. There is no ductwork and labor from a contractor involved, so it’s perfect for renters, for small homeowners or even for food truck operators.

Even though they do not fully remove moisture and heat (like the **ducted versions do**), the **latest models of ductless hoods** are quite effective, when equipped with **high capacity fans** and high quality filters, at controlling moisture, heat, and odor. In fact, many of the newest models come with **multi-layer filtration** with **multiple, adjustable speeds**, which increase effectiveness.

What's the catch? Depending on your cooking frequency, you will need to replace the charcoal filters every 3 to 6 months, and they may not be as effective at removing smoke and odor from high-output cooking (such as frying) as ducted models are.  

But if you’re cooking in a condo, apartment, or a kitchen that doesn’t have access to an external vent, a ductless hood can be a huge solution.

## **Do Ductless Range Hoods Actually Work?**

Let's be honest here: when someone asks, "Do ductless range hoods really work?" there is usually a degree of skepticism. And it is no wonder why! You want to make sure you are not buying a pretty decoration for the kitchen, but something that will help clean the air.

So here is the fact: yes, **ductless range hoods do work**, but a **few things influence the capabilities.**

First: **Filter Type.** Cheap charcoal filters will do little more than trap light odors. Higher quality activated carbon filters can reduce cooking smells heavily, even after cooking things like bacon and sautéed garlic. Always check the filter grade!

Second: **Fan Power**. If you do regular cooking, look for hoods with a minimal engine power rating of around **200-400 CFM (cubic feet per minute).** Anything lower could be weak and perform little more than light duty chores. If you cook regularly as a stir fry master or grill indoors, you need higher, like 600+ CFM.

Third: **Cooking Style.** While I find a ductless hood enough for light cooking, like boiling pasta or heating up leftovers, it can be severely ineffective if you sear, fry, or cook with bold spices regularly. In that case, I recommend that you get a ducted model, preferably one with multi-layer filtration and/or dual fan motors for more circulation.

So, who benefits most from these hoods?

* **Apartment dwellers**
* **Tiny home owners**
* **People with no exterior duct access**
* **DIY kitchen renovators**

Still questioning? Think of it this way: brands like Hauslane, Cosmo and Broan are designing high-end recirculating hoods that rival their ducted version jam for jam. They're quiet, look nice, and have a mad amount of power when you use the proper filters.

In short: they do work, but only if you select the appropriate unit and maintain it. Otherwise, it's like using a sieve with holes in the bottom - useless.

## **What is a Good CFM for a Ductless Range Hood?**

Now let's get into numbers—specifically, CFM. You've seen CFM listed in each range hood spec sheet, but what does it actually mean?  

CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) is a measurement of the amount of air your hood can move. For ductless hoods, this measurement is very important since all filtering and circulation occur in the hood, internally. Higher CFM means more power from your fan, which in turn means your hood is able to pull in more grease, smoke, and odors.

That said, more CFM isn't always better. Here is a quick guide:

* Light cooking like boiling (150-250 CFM) 
* Normal cooking like sautéing (300 - 400 CFM)
* Heavy cooking with a lot of frying (500 - 700 )
* Professional/commercial cooking (700+ CFM)

The best ductless models will usually have a sweet spot of around 400 - 600 CFM, where you get the best performance without excessive energy consumption or excessive noise.

Also, don’t forget to look at fan speeds. A good ductless range hood will have multiple speed settings, so you can switch between low and high power depending on what you’re cooking.

Pro Tip: CFM alone isn’t enough. Make sure the filters and air circulation paths are designed well. Some budget hoods boast high CFM but use inferior charcoal filters, which defeats the purpose.

So, if you’re deep frying or grilling indoors, go for high suction ductless range hoods with advanced filtration. If you’re after a basic unit for light cooking, 250–300 CFM with replaceable charcoal filters should do the trick.

## **How Efficient is a Ductless Range Hood?**

Efficiency is where the ductless hood really starts to earn its place. It may not vent hot air outside, but when designed properly, it can be surprisingly effective at cleaning your kitchen air.

Here's a breakdown of how to assess efficiency:

1. Replacement of filters – Regular maintenance = steady performance
2. Fan strength vs. filter
   strength – a strong fan + weak filter = bad performance.  Balance is key.
3. Noise – lower noise (in sones) stronger noise/weight usually suggest a more efficient design. 
4. Energy Used-ductless hoods generally use less energy than ducted hoods, and tend to be
   cheaper and more environmentally friendly.

Modern designs now include features like:

* Energy-efficient LED lighting
* Auto shut-off timers
* Touch controls with airflow sensors

Additionally, certain premium models include heat sensors, which automatically change the fan speed when a certain amount of steam or smoke is detected, here is where we can see true efficiency. 

If you mind energy use and air quality, the great news is you can avoid duct work by investing in a ductless hood, but it needs to be a strong filtration system with a compatible fan. 

A ductless hood can be seen as a hybrid car, without as much power as a performance model, but more efficient, less maintenance, and just easier to own.

## **What to Look for in a Ductless Range Hood?**

When it's time to shop for the best ductless range hood, not all range hoods are built the same. Just because it looks nice on the outside, doesn't mean it has what it takes on the inside (pun intended).

So, here's a checklist to guide you:

### **Size and Fit**

Always choose a hood that is at least as wide as your cooktop and ideally 3–6 inches wider. For example, when looking for a hood for a 30-inch range, you should choose a 36-inch hood, assuming you have the space.

### **Mounting Type**

You have choices:

* Under-Cabinet (good option for small kitchens)
* Wall-Mounted (a stylish and visible option)
* Island/Ceiling Mount (good option for an open kitchen)
* Insert Range Hoods (hides in the cabinetry)

Choose what best fits your kitchen layout.

### **Filter Type**

Look for:

* Charcoal filters if you are interested in eliminating odors 
* Mesh filters if you want to trap grease (and are easy to clean)
* Baffle filters if you want durable filtration 

Pro tip: You can look for all the above mentioned options in reusable filters, which are better for the environment and will save you money in the long run!

### **Fan Speeds and Noise**

* At least 3 fan speeds
* Open kitchens will benefit from a noise level under 6 sones (~65 dB)

### **Extras**

* Touch controls/remote
* Auto shutoff timers
* LED lighting to see the cooktop properly
* Dishwasher-safe filters

Don't forget about looks. **Slim, low-profile ductless hoods**, are modern and don't take up much space; an excellent choice for small kitchens!

Lastly, be sure to check out the warranty and brand name. Names like Broan, Cosmo, Hauslane, and Winflo come highly recommended for reliability and performance!

## **How High Should a Ductless Range Hood Be Installed?**

It may not seem like a huge issue, but the mounting height is one of the most significant aspects of both efficiency and safety. It's important that a ductless range hood is installed at an appropriate height above your cooktop in order to optimize performance and avoid damage.

So what is an appropriate height? 

The general recommendation is 24 to 30 inches above the cooking surface for electric cooktops and 25 to 30 inches for gas stoves. 

If you install it too low, you might overheat the range hood or create a potential hazard. If you install it too high, the range hood will not be effective because it has lost its suction power, meaning the fumes, grease and smoke just escape before they are filtered. 

Some manufacturers will provide their own specific installation height recommendations for their models, particularly for wall-mounted or island-style hoods. Always reference the instruction manual, but also have the guide above in mind as a general rule of thumb.

So what happens if the hood is too low or too high?

* **Too Low:** You could damage it by heat or splatter, and it could also get in the way of your eyesight.
* **Too High:** It will not trap air as well. You might notice that smells linger longer and that more grease builds up on walls.

Insider tip: For a wall-mounted or island ductless hood, use a laser level to ensure alignment and avoid uneven installation. An unevenly mounted hood can look off and performance can be hindered.

Mounting height also affects design continuity. You want the hood to match the height of your backsplash and cabinetry, not be a visual obstruction. For under-cabinet installations, use a slim ductless under-cabinet range hood to avoid visual clutter.

Ultimately, the right mounting height will maximize suction, safety, aesthetics, and more. Don't eyeball it, measure it.

### **Is a 30″ or 36″ Ductless Range Hood Better?**

Let's address one of the biggest questions in kitchen design: 30-inch vs 36-inch ductless range hoods. Which size should you purchase?

The correct answer? It depends on the width of your range and how you cook.

As a general rule, your range hood should be the same width as your cooking surface, but ideally for optimum grease and smoke capture it should be 3-6 inches wider than the cooking surface.

This allows the range hood to essentially capture as much smoke and steam as possible (even from your edge burners).

So, if your stove is:

* 30-inch wide → both a 30 or a 36-inch hood will suffice (36 is better and will provide full coverage)
* 36-inch wide → always use a 36-inch hood or bigger

Now let's breakdown the reasons for purchasing a 30-inch or 36-inch hood.

**A 30-inch hood is adequate when:** 

* You only cook a few times a week and are not heavy on frying or grilling.
* You have space challenges like having cabinets that are too close to the burners or a very tight layout.
* You are on a small budget.

**A 36-inch hood is warranted at all times when:** 

* You cook generally every day and are doing high heat cooking like searing, grilling, or stir-frying.
* You want the best suction and the most coverage.
* You use larger pans or your meal preparation requires pots and pans on every burner every time you cook. 
* You are taking advantage of the long term capabilities of the appliance and want to limit any lingering smells within your home.

Another variable? **Aesthetic.** A 36” hood over a 30” range reinforces a bold, authoritative culinary statement and will also make it less likely to get grease stains on adjacent cabinetry or walls. 

So, what's the conclusion? 

If space and budget allow, I would recommend a 36” ductless range hood for overall better coverage, cleaner air and a more high-end look. If you are tight on space or do not do heavy-duty cooking, a quality 30” range hood should still suffice- just be sure it has adequate airflow (400+ CFM) and adequate filters.

## **How Much Wider Should a Range Hood Be Than the Range?**

This one’s simple but super important: the range hood should be at least 3 inches wider than your range on either side—6 inches if you can. Why? Because cooking fumes do not rise directly up like a laser beam would—cooking fumes radiate, especially when frying, grilling, or boiling on side burners.

Experts recommend you at least have:

* Minimum: 3 inches of overhang on either side of your range
* Ideal: 6 inches of overhang on either side of your range

What this means is that for a 30-inch cooktop you should be using a 36 to 42-inch range hood if available. 

**Advantages of having a wider hood:**

* Better coverage across the entire surface area of your stove, no smoke escapes from the sides
* Less grease on walls or cabinets nearby
* Improved air quality and less odors
* More space for multi-pot cooking, larger pans, etc.

If you are using a ductless model, this becomes even more important. Since ductless models recirculate air rather than doing a direct vent-exhaust, larger exhaust area is crucial to maintaining a clean kitchen. 

A wider hood will also help with more even air flow distribution, and minimize hot spots, making your hood more efficient overall. 

Bottom line: go bigger, wider than your range if you can—especially if you are using a ductless hood where airflow is of utmost importance.

## **Quiet Ductless Range Hoods: Which Is the Quietest?**

Nobody wants to cook under a jet engine. Therefore, finding a quiet ductless range hood is a priority for many homeowners, especially open-concept kitchens, and noise-sensitive homes.

So, what makes a hood “quiet”?

It comes down to decibel ratings or sones—the unit used to measure sound in home appliances.

Here’s a quick reference chart:

Sones	Sound Level

1.0–2.0	Very Quiet (like a fridge)

2.5–3.0	Moderate (fan noise)

4.0+	Noticeable (vacuum cleaner)

For ductless hoods, anything below 3 sones (~50 dB) is considered quiet. The best models come with brushless motors, sound insulation, and balanced airflow design to reduce noise.

Some top picks for quiet operation:

* Hauslane Chef Series WM-538 – Powerful yet whisper-quiet, even at high speed.
* Cosmo 5U30 – Slim and quiet under-cabinet design with 3 fan speeds.
* Broan-NuTone BCDF130SS – A budget option with low noise and strong filtration.

Also, look for soft-touch controls and quiet start motors—these features make operation smoother and less jarring.

Remember: higher CFM typically means more noise. So it’s about finding the right balance between power and peace.

If your kitchen is connected to your living room or you cook during baby’s nap time, investing in a quiet range hood is 100% worth it. It's like switching from a noisy window AC to a central air system—still does the job, but without the racket.

## **Convertible Ductless-to-Ducted Models**

Feeling stuck between ducted and ductless options? Don’t worry—you don’t have to choose. Enter: the convertible range hood.

A convertible hood can operate in both ducted and ductless modes. That means you can install it ductless now and switch to ducted later if your kitchen setup changes.

Here’s why they’re a fantastic middle-ground:

**Flexibility**

* Renting now but planning a reno later? No problem.
* Moving homes? Take it with you and adapt it to the new space.

**Cost-Effective**

* Avoid spending extra on a full ducted setup unless necessary.
* Start ductless and upgrade when you’re ready.

**Same Features, Same Quality**

Many convertible hoods, like the Cosmo COS-63175S or Hauslane WM-739, include:

* 3–6 fan speeds
* LED lighting
* High-CFM airflow (400–900 CFM)
* Optional charcoal filter kits for ductless use

**Great for DIY Installs**

Most models come with both ducted and ductless components, including a rear or top vent option, plus a charcoal filter conversion kit.

If you're building your forever kitchen or want future-proof flexibility, a convertible hood is a smart, safe investment.

## **Best Ductless Range Hood with Charcoal Filter**

When it comes to clean air and odor elimination, the real MVP in ductless range hoods is the charcoal filter. Without a high-quality charcoal filter, even the best ductless hood becomes nothing more than a decorative fan.

So, what should you look for in the best ductless range hood with a charcoal filter?

**Filtration Performance**

The charcoal filter should be dense, well-fitted, and ideally multi-layered. Some premium models even include dual filters or additional mesh grease traps that protect the charcoal layer—improving its lifespan and efficiency.

**Easy Replacement**

Check if the filter can be replaced without tools. Bonus points for models with filter replacement indicators so you’re never guessing when it's time to swap.

**Top Picks:**

**1.Cosmo 5U30 Under-Cabinet Hood**

**Maintenance Tip:**

Replace your charcoal filter every 3–6 months depending on your cooking frequency. If you cook daily, opt for a filter with a higher odor absorption rating and better coverage.

So, if you fry, grill, or just hate lingering odors in your kitchen, investing in the best ductless range hood with a powerful charcoal filter is non-negotiable.

## **Best Ductless Range Hood Under Cabinet**

## **How to Clean and Maintain a Ductless Range Hood**

Let’s face it—nobody loves cleaning their range hood. But if you own a ductless one, maintenance isn’t optional—it’s essential. Because you’re not venting air outside, those filters are your only line of defense against lingering smells, grease, and airborne grime.

Here’s how to keep your ductless range hood running at full power:

### **Step-by-Step Cleaning Routine:**

1. Unplug the hood or switch off power.

2. Remove the filters.

* **Grease filters** (mesh or baffle) should be soaked in hot soapy water or run through the dishwasher.
* **Charcoal filters** should be replaced, not washed. Look for the replacement interval in your manual—typically every 3–6 months.

3. Wipe the hood’s exterior and interior with a non-abrasive cleaner. Stainless steel polish helps maintain shine.

4. Clean the fan blades if accessible (with a soft cloth—no water on electrical components).

5. Check the lights and switches for buildup. Use a soft brush or vacuum if needed.

### **When to Perform Maintenance:**

* Clean grease filters	Every 2–4 weeks
* Replace charcoal filter	Every 3–6 months
* Wipe hood exterior	Weekly
* Deep clean internal fan	Every 6–12 months

A well-maintained ductless hood doesn’t just perform better—it lasts longer, smells fresher, and keeps your kitchen looking clean and modern.

## **Can You Install a Ductless Range Hood Yourself?**

Short answer? Yes, you can—and many people do. Ductless range hoods are one of the most DIY-friendly appliances in your kitchen. They don’t require vent installation, which means no drilling through walls or hiring HVAC pros.

**What You’ll Need:**

* Power drill
* Screwdriver set
* Tape measure
* Pencil/marker
* Level
* Mounting screws & brackets (usually included)
* Charcoal filter (if not pre-installed)

### **Installation Steps (Wall or Cabinet Mount):**

Measure and mark mounting height. Usually 24–30 inches above your cooktop.

1. **Locate wall studs or cabinet base.** Use a stud finder or pre-installed bracket.
2. **Drill pilot holes.** Ensure they're level.
3. **Mount the hood securely.** Secure brackets to studs or support beams.
4. **Connect power. Plug-in models are easiest.** If it’s hardwired, turn off the breaker first.
5. **Install charcoal filters.** Slot them behind or above the fan system depending on model.

Most models include easy-to-follow templates and detailed instruction manuals. If you're comfortable hanging a shelf or curtain rod, you can likely install a ductless hood.

Just make sure to have a helper if your hood is over 25 lbs—some units are bulky and need two hands for steady placement.

## **Ductless vs Ducted Range Hood – Which Should You Choose?**

Let’s break this down. If you're stuck deciding between a ductless or ducted range hood, here’s the pros and cons straight up.

**Choose Ductless if:**

## **What Are the Best Ductless Range Hoods?** 

The best ductless range hoods are non-ducted hoods which recirculate air, rather than extracting it. Re-circulation enhances the air quality in the cooking perimeter by purifying and redistributing it around the stove area. 

They recycle the air by sucking it using a fan of all the harmful pollutant agents.

As compared to exhaust hoods, which emits air out, the ductless hood cleans the impure air into degreasing filters, followed by charcoal carbon filters, and then remitting the air back to the room. 

Why is the best ductless range hood the right appliance for your kitchen?

It’s because it is inexpensive and saves a lot of time and effort due to its lack of a ventilation ductwork system. This saves and creates a lot of kitchen space since you don’t need to sacrifice space for the air duct that comes with the ventilation system.

* **Filters Efficacy**

As read throughout the article, filters are an important aspect for the best ductless range hoods to effectively and efficiently perform. For that reason, one should closely look at the three kinds of filters required for use. These include; **charcoal filters, baffle filters, and mesh filters**. 

Charcoal filters are essential for the re-circulation and filtration of odors, smoke, and absorption of fumes emitted in the kitchen. This is the compulsory equipment needed for the operation of the machine effectively. However, they need replacement every once in a while.

Baffle filters are important in collecting hazardous material through greased baffles by quickly collecting the trickled down materials in a tray. Hence, thorough cleaning is required every few months to increase its durability.

Mesh filters are a significant aspect of the range hoods as well. Fitted behind one another, the greasy air passing through the meshes are trapped and collected in a tray. Hence, they require regular cleaning for better operation. 

* **Suction**

The best ductless range hoods require an efficient CFM (Cubic Feet per Meter), which is the measure of power in a range hood, depending on the workload required. Before purchasing, be sure to ideally look at the size of the kitchen, food cooked, the volume of cooked food, number of burners, length of ducting and so much more. In as much as the suction is low to some appliances, the importance remains on the filtration system’s effectiveness. 

* **Size and Power**

Large stoves require larger ventilation systems, thus, it is important to look for a ventilation system that matches the size of your stove and the food being cooked. The range hood should be able to have enough coverage to catch all the emissions.
