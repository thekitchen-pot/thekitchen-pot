If you have been considering getting a range hood, but you cannot vent it outdoors because of ductwork restrictions in your kitchen, then you might just have a new best friend: a ductless range
hood. Also called recirculating hoods or non-vented hoods, they work by pulling in air, filtering out the grease, smoke, and odors and returning the filtered air back into your kitchen. 

So, how do they really work?

Essentially, air is extracted into the hood by a fan located inside the hood. Think of the extraction process as similar to the fan you may have in your bathroom. The air passes through a **grease filter** (typically aluminum mesh or stainless steel baffles), that captures airborne particles of grease. The filtered air then continues through the **activated charcoal filters** that eliminate odors and smoke. Lastly, the filtered air is returned back to the kitchen space.

With ductless range hoods, there are no ducts. No outside venting. Just cleaner indoor air.

Sounds great, right?

But like any fantastic invention, it has its caveats. One major plus is **installation is very easy**. You can mount it on your wall, under a cabinet or on your ceiling if you want to get fancy. There is no ductwork and labor from a contractor involved, so it’s perfect for renters, for small homeowners or even for food truck operators.

Even though they do not fully remove moisture and heat (like the **ducted versions do**), the **latest models of ductless hoods** are quite effective, when equipped with **high capacity fans** and high quality filters, at controlling moisture, heat, and odor. In fact, many of the newest models come with **multi-layer filtration** with **multiple, adjustable speeds**, which increase effectiveness.

What's the catch? Depending on your cooking frequency, you will need to replace the charcoal filters every 3 to 6 months, and they may not be as effective at removing smoke and odor from high-output cooking (such as frying) as ducted models are.  

But if you’re cooking in a condo, apartment, or a kitchen that doesn’t have access to an external vent, a ductless hood can be a huge solution.

## **Do Ductless Range Hoods Actually Work?**

Let's be honest here: when someone asks, "Do ductless range hoods really work?" there is usually a degree of skepticism. And it is no wonder why! You want to make sure you are not buying a pretty decoration for the kitchen, but something that will help clean the air.

So here is the fact: yes, **ductless range hoods do work**, but a **few things influence the capabilities.**

First: **Filter Type.** Cheap charcoal filters will do little more than trap light odors. Higher quality activated carbon filters can reduce cooking smells heavily, even after cooking things like bacon and sautéed garlic. Always check the filter grade!

Second: **Fan Power**. If you do regular cooking, look for hoods with a minimal engine power rating of around **200-400 CFM (cubic feet per minute).** Anything lower could be weak and perform little more than light duty chores. If you cook regularly as a stir fry master or grill indoors, you need higher, like 600+ CFM.

Third: **Cooking Style.** While I find a ductless hood enough for light cooking, like boiling pasta or heating up leftovers, it can be severely ineffective if you sear, fry, or cook with bold spices regularly. In that case, I recommend that you get a ducted model, preferably one with multi-layer filtration and/or dual fan motors for more circulation.

So, who benefits most from these hoods?

* **Apartment dwellers**
* **Tiny home owners**
* **People with no exterior duct access**
* **DIY kitchen renovators**

Still questioning? Think of it this way: brands like Hauslane, Cosmo and Broan are designing high-end recirculating hoods that rival their ducted version jam for jam. They're quiet, look nice, and have a mad amount of power when you use the proper filters.

In short: they do work, but only if you select the appropriate unit and maintain it. Otherwise, it's like using a sieve with holes in the bottom - useless.

## **What Are the Best Ductless Range Hoods?** 

The best ductless range hoods are non-ducted hoods which recirculate air, rather than extracting it. Re-circulation enhances the air quality in the cooking perimeter by purifying and redistributing it around the stove area. 

They recycle the air by sucking it using a fan of all the harmful pollutant agents.

As compared to exhaust hoods, which emits air out, the ductless hood cleans the impure air into degreasing filters, followed by charcoal carbon filters, and then remitting the air back to the room. 

Why is the best ductless range hood the right appliance for your kitchen?

It’s because it is inexpensive and saves a lot of time and effort due to its lack of a ventilation ductwork system. This saves and creates a lot of kitchen space since you don’t need to sacrifice space for the air duct that comes with the ventilation system. 

Therefore, let’s look at some of the best ductless range hood we have at the market;

## **Best** **Ductless Range Hoods –** **Buyer’s Guide**

There are several types of range hoods in the market. The key categories include [under cabinet hoods](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-under-cabinet-range-hood//), wall mount hoods, island hoods, ductless hoods, and downdraft hoods. This article analyzes the best ductless range hoods that you can consider when shopping.

When picking the best ductless range hood to either remodel, for a newly built, or replace the existing, you need to be decisive by looking at several factors. Enough research is required for the proper maintenance, and [installation](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-a-Range-Hood), as they fundamentally need more attention, compared to vented hoods. 

To ease your process, we’ve compiled some of the best factors to consider when it comes to selecting the best ductless range hood for your kitchen.  

### Factors to Consider When Shopping for the Best Ductless Range Hood

* **Budget**

With the numerous available ductless range hoods in the market, the only way to create a shortlist for the items chosen is the budget.

The best ductless range hood can be a large investment, but by looking at its potential durability which might go for years, it happens to be the best choice.

One ought to be generous with the investments to be included for the purchase. **If you’re short of funds and resources, it’s wiser to take a few months to financially save to cover for the amount remaining**. I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.

* **Filters Efficacy**

As read throughout the article, filters are an important aspect for the best ductless range hoods to effectively and efficiently perform. For that reason, one should closely look at the three kinds of filters required for use. These include; **charcoal filters, baffle filters, and mesh filters**. 

Charcoal filters are essential for the re-circulation and filtration of odors, smoke, and absorption of fumes emitted in the kitchen. This is the compulsory equipment needed for the operation of the machine effectively. However, they need replacement every once in a while.

Baffle filters are important in collecting hazardous material through greased baffles by quickly collecting the trickled down materials in a tray. Hence, thorough cleaning is required every few months to increase its durability.

Mesh filters are a significant aspect of the range hoods as well. Fitted behind one another, the greasy air passing through the meshes are trapped and collected in a tray. Hence, they require regular cleaning for better operation. 

* **Suction**

The best ductless range hoods require an efficient CFM (Cubic Feet per Meter), which is the measure of power in a range hood, depending on the workload required. Before purchasing, be sure to ideally look at the size of the kitchen, food cooked, the volume of cooked food, number of burners, length of ducting and so much more. In as much as the suction is low to some appliances, the importance remains on the filtration system’s effectiveness. 

* **Size and Power**

Large stoves require larger ventilation systems, thus, it is important to look for a ventilation system that matches the size of your stove and the food being cooked. The range hood should be able to have enough coverage to catch all the emissions. 

* **Aesthetics** 

If you are aiming for particular aesthetics to match your décor, you need to find a range hood with the same style as per your expectations. Given the hundreds of ductless range hoods available, it’s easier to find models that suit your particular taste.
