## **What Are the Best Ductless Range Hoods?** 

The best ductless range hoods are non-ducted hoods which recirculate air, rather than extracting it. Re-circulation enhances the air quality in the cooking perimeter by purifying and redistributing it around the stove area. 

They recycle the air by sucking it using a fan of all the harmful pollutant agents.

Why is the best ductless range hood the right appliance for your kitchen?

It’s because it is inexpensive and saves a lot of time and effort due to its lack of a ventilation ductwork system. This saves and creates a lot of kitchen space since you don’t need to sacrifice space for the air duct that comes with the ventilation system.
