Cooking is all fun until you start encountering unfamiliar measuring units. For example, how many tablespoons in 1/3 cup? How many ounces in a quart? If you’ve yourself in the units conversion dilemma, then we’ve got your back!

## Why Metric Conversion is Important

If you love cooking, you’ll appreciate the importance of hacking the measuring units question. A meal that would otherwise have been scrumptious can become unpalatable because of an excess ingredient!

Yes, if a recipe states that you add 2 tablespoons of **[olive oil](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-oil-for-air-fryer//)** (or any other ingredient), you should be careful to follow the instruction, lest your meal becomes a waste.

While following the instruction is the easier part, there is the more complicated assignment of knowing the exact amount of ingredients required when using the measuring units available at your disposal.

For example, when you have a recipe stating amounts in Quarts while your measuring container is in cups, you must get the conversion right to hack the recipe. 

The conversion knowledge helps you to cook delicious meals that every member of your family will enjoy. It also ensures that you avoid wastages by using just the right amounts of ingredients required. 

## How Many Ounces in a Quart?

### **What is an Oz?**

An ounce (Oz) is a unit of measuring weight equivalent to one-sixteenth of a pound. It is approximately 28 grams or 29.57 MLS. 

### **What is a Quart?**

A quart is a unit of measuring liquid substances equivalent to a quarter of a gallon or 2 pints (0.94 liters).

### **Is an Ounce the Same as Fluid Ounce?**

The two use the same measuring concept but measures different substances. However, an ounce is used to measure the weight and mass of solid substances, while a fluid ounce is used to measure the volumetric properties of fluids/liquids. 

While the two measuring units carry the same name, you should never mistake them to mean the same. They are different! 

For example, if one cup of water equals 8 fluid ounces and weighs 8 ounces. However, this cannot be the same as every other ingredient that occupies the same volume. A cup of flour will measure approximately 4 ounces, while flour paste will measure about 7.8 fluid ounces.

As such, the solid and liquid measurement metrics will always vary depending on their nature, among many other factors. You should, therefore, never use the two units interchangeably – they are different! 

### So, How Many Ounces are In a Quart?

According to the [US conversion](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/pml/wmd/metric/1136a.pdf) metrics:

**One Quart = 32 Ounces / 2 Pints**

The British system is a bit different since one Quart will be equal to 40 Oz. However, we’ll work with the US system.

## How many Cups in a Pint?

Since we’ve already indicated that a quart =32 ounces=2 pints, it is best to indicate the number of cups in each pint. This conversion metric is particularly crucial since most of the measuring in the kitchen is done through cups. 

**1 Pint = 2 Cups = 8 Fluid Ounces** 

Since a quart equals to 2 pints, which is equivalent to 4 cups. It is correct to say that:

**1 Quart = 32 Fluid Ounces** 

Based on this, you can use the following summary to guide you through the measuring process:

-   1 Quart = 2 Pints = 32 Fluid Ounces = 4 Cups
-   1 Pint = 2 Cups = 16 Fluid Ounces 
-   1 Cup = 8 Fluid Ounces

Therefore, if a recipe asks that you use two pints of milk, you can use 4 cups. If it asks that you use 16 fluid ounces, then use 2 cups of the ingredient. This conversation summary will help you play with the conversion numbers until you achieve one you’re comfortable with. 

## How Many Tablespoons in a 1/3 Cup?

1/3 cup of any ingredients will be equal to 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon. So, how many tablespoons are in a cup? The simple answer to this is:

**1 Cup = 16 tablespoons**

### **What is the Difference Between Tablespoon and Teaspoon?**

A [tablespoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablespoon) is ideally a large spoon that is used for serving food/ eating. On the contrary, a teaspoon is a smaller spoon used to add sugar and stirring tea.

**1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons** 

Additionally, 1 US tablespoon is equivalent to 14.79 ml while 1 US teaspoon is equal to 4.9 ml. 

## What is Gallon?

A gallon is a unit of measurement that is equivalent to four quarts. That is equivalent to 16 cups and 8 pints. 

## Metric Conversion -the Bottom Line

Measuring your ingredients with precision is necessary if you’re to get the best cooking results. As such, you must be conversant with the metric conversion. 

Most recipes use various metric units ranging from pints, quarts, ounces, cups, and tablespoons. We’ve curated an all-inclusive guide that will help you with the conversions.
