![Best Stackable Pots and Pans ](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

360 cookware is the go-to manufacturer if you value waterless cooking. Their pans and pots are designed uniquely to allow you to cook using natural juices, thus retaining natural flavors. As such, you can be sure that these pans will yield healthy and tasty meals. 

This 360 cookware fry pan set comes with short handles that make it possible to stack them, thus saving space. However, the short handles will still protrude, which can make it rather inconvenient for camping. 

[Visit 360 Cookware Website](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1585061&u=2750617&m=99639&urllink=www%2E360cookware%2Ecom%2Fcollections%2Fsets%2Fproducts%2F3%2Dpiece%2Dfry%2Dpan%2Dset%2Dwith%2Dshort%2Dhandles&afftrack=)

As such, you may want to consider a different set if you’re looking for [camping/hiking cookware](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-camping-cookware//). Nevertheless, the handles will not affect storage in a cabinet or on top of your countertop. 

Therefore, the 360 cookware pans and pots are the best bet for healthy meals and guaranteed convenience in your kitchen. 

The set includes 8.5 inches, 10 inches, and 11.5 inches fry pans with short handles. It comes with a user and care guide as well as a certificate of authenticity. The few pans available makes it the best cookware set for beginners.

The pans are oven safe up to 500 degrees thus allowing you to bake and cook everything you need for your breakfast and dinner. Even better, 360 cookware is induction-friendly. It is made of 3-ply .110 gauge thickness all around.

The interior of the cooking surface layer is made out of T-304 surgical grade stainless steel which is corrosion-resistant thus ensuring food safety. The core comprises an aluminum layer that has the best heat conductivity and distributes the heat evenly throughout the pan.

Finally, the exterior layer is made of T-400 surgical stainless steel. This metal is not reactive and allows the use of an induction burner. As such, you can be sure that 360 cookware pots and pans will work perfectly regardless of the cooktop you are using.

Calphalon is designed with optimum non-stick properties that guarantee effortless cooking. It releases food fast, thus ensuring that your meals do not stick on the pan. 

However, we advise that you **use low-medium heat** if you want to get the best results. We realized that using high temperatures results in sticking and can consequently lead to dark spots on the pan. 

[Check Price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Premier-Space-Saving-Nonstick/dp/B072NGDV46?tag=kitchenpot-20)

Additionally, this Calphalon hard-anodized is constructed using a 3-layer nonstick interior. While Calphalon advises that this layer is strong enough to withstand pressure from metallic utensils, we recommend that you use silicone or wooden ones. **Repeated scratching by the metallic spatulas can lead to loss of non-stick properties fas**t. 

Unlike ordinary aluminum, a hard-anodized one does not react with your food. As such, you will be guaranteed your safety as you cook with this Calphalon hard-anodized pan set. 

The exterior of the pan is hard-anodized making it safe to use a dishwasher. The hard-anodized aluminum is a superconductor of heat and cooks evenly, thus eliminating hotspots.

Gotham Steel is one of the most reputable nonstick companies. It is known for its **[Gotham Steel Smokeless Grill](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/gotham-steel-smokeless-grill-review//)**.

The Gotham Steel pans come with interchangeable tempered glass lids. You can use it with all the saucepans, fry pans, stockpots, and skillets. Additionally, the glass lids enable you to monitor the progress of your meals without having to open the lid, thus retaining the natural flavors. 

The pan’s stay cool handles features make it safe. However, t**he stay-cool feature is not entirely true when you cook using a high temperature**. In cases when you’re using an oven, we recommend that you have [heat-resistant gloves](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/10-best-heat-resistant-gloves-for-cooking//) for guaranteed safety (you can use these pans in an oven up to 550 degrees F).

## How to Choose the Best Stackable Pots and Pans as Seen on TV 

If you intend to buy space-saving cookware, you should evaluate your needs before settling for the best stackable pots and pans set in the market. Some of the questions that you should answer before stepping out to shop include:

-   What do you need the stackable pots and pans sets for?
-   What is the size of your kitchen? Do you have kitchen cabinets?
-   What stovetop are you using? 
-   Are they stackable? 

### **Shopping Based on Need**

If you intend to buy stack cooking pots for camping, we recommend that you buy lightweight cookware that you can carry without a hassle. Additionally, camping cookware must be versatile for use in [open fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoor_cooking).

### **Stackability** 

To get value for money, we recommend that you buy cookware that has detachable handles. This way, you will be guaranteed stackability that will surely save your space. Such pots and pans will fit in your cabinet and countertop space without a hassle. 

### **Your Stovetop**

When shopping, you should be careful to consider pots and pans that are compatible with your stovetop. You should be keen if you are using an induction hob. Most cookware sets are not compatible with induction cooktops! 

### **Type of Lids**

To get the best stackability, we recommend that you get pots and pans with flat lids. This way, you will not have the urge to **[buy a lid organizer](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Kitchen-Dining-Pot-Lid-Holders/zgbs/kitchen/13750001?tag=kitchenpot-20)** since they will neatly nest for ease of storage. 

## Tips on How to Care for Stackable Pots 

One of the biggest worries among homeowners is that their stackable pots and pans will crack due to frequent friction. While this is possible, there are several tips that you can use to care for these pots and eliminate the risk. They include:

-   **Be Gentle.** When stacking your pots and pans, you should always be gentle. Avoid banging your pots or using unnecessarily high pressure when storing them.
-   **Use a Paper Towel or Dish Towel.** If your stackable pots are prone to scratches, you should use a paper towel to form a barrier between the stacked cookware. This will prevent direct contact, thus minimizing the risk of scratches and cracks. 
-   **Clean the Pots After Use.** You should always clean your pots immediately after use. However, we recommend that you avoid abrasive materials. Instead, use a soft sponge, warm water, and soap to wipe off the debris.
-   **Dry Your Pans.** Before storing your pans, you should always ensure that your pans are dry. 

Additionally, we advise that you do not store [cast iron cookware](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/lodge-cast-iron-skillet-review//) together with your stackable cookware. Instead, learn [how to store cookware here](https://www.wikihow.com/Store-Cast-Iron-Cookware).
