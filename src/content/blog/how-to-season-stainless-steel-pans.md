When you season your pans, you’ll use oils. The oil is relatively viscous and is believed to fill in the pores in your stainless steel pan.

However, you should note that regular cleaning of your stainless steel with soap and warm water will open up the pores. As such, we recommend that you season your pans at least thrice a year to maintain the top-notch performance.
