Dutch ovens are versatile. These cast-iron cookware can braise your meat, boil water for pasta, deep fry, and bake, among many other applications. They are a must-have for any serious cook or professional chef. 

But there is a catch! High-quality cast iron Dutch ovens are not cheap.

Some of the high-end brands such as **[Le Creuset](https://www.amazon.com/Creuset-Signature-Enameled-Cast-Iron-2-Quart/dp/B0076NOGPY/?tag=kitchenpot-20)** and **[Staub Dutch Ovens](https://www.amazon.com/Staub-Round-Cocotte-4-Quart-Cherry/dp/B003G65YQ0?tag=kitchenpot-20)** will demand that you sacrifice more than $200. While there are other affordable brands such as **[Lodge Dutch Oven](https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Enameled-Classic-Enamel-Island/dp/B000N501BK/?tag=kitchenpot-20)**, their longevity cannot be compared to these high-end brands!

If that sounds too much to spend, then worry not. We’ve got your back.

**[Milo Dutch Oven](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1172085&u=2750617&m=79356&urllink=&afftrack=0)** is a relatively new entrant in the high-end cookware niche. This unique Dutch oven is top-notch. And affordable. 

The Milo Dutch oven demystifies the belief that high-quality must always be expensive. When you buy this product directly from the manufacturer, you’ll **[get it at approximately $135](https://shrsl.com/2vk77)** – almost half the price of your ordinary high-end Dutch oven. 

But is it equal to the task? Can a Milo Dutch oven equal the performance of Le Creuset and other expensive Dutch ovens? We tested the performance of the **[Classic Milo Dutch oven](https://shrsl.com/2vk7r)**, and the results were incredibly amazing. Here’s what we found out.

## What is Milo Dutch Oven Made Of?

If you’re wondering what the [differences between enameled and regular cast iron](https://www.chatelaine.com/food/kitchen-tips/difference-cast-iron-cookware/) Dutch ovens are, then here is a comprehensive answer.

Enameled cast iron has a **vitreous enamel glaze coating the surface**. The fusion of this glaze coating has several benefits, including:

-   It prevents rusting
-   It improves aesthetics and the Dutch Oven can be made in different colors
-   Eliminates the need to season
-   Easy-wipe cleaning 

Just like any other cast iron cookware, Milo Enameled Dutch oven h**eats slowly but retains heat for longer** than other cookware made from materials such as stainless steel and aluminum.

However, these benefits come at a cost. Enameled cast iron pots and pans are more expensive than their bare cast iron counterparts.  

**Do not use abrasive materials when cleaning your Milo enameled Dutch oven since it can lead to warping. The surfaces are smooth and easy to clean using sponges and other soft materials.**

## Pros and Cons of Using Enameled Cast Iron Cookware

Cast iron cookware is among the safest options compared to aluminum, copper, and **[Teflon-coated pans](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-nonstick-pans-with-buying-guide//)**. 

However, there is very negligent leaching of iron into your food. While this is considered harmless, long-term accumulation can lead to iron toxicity. **Note that this risk is minimal but especially high when you use your iron cookware to cook acidic food regularly.** 

To help you eliminate this problem, **[Milo cookware](https://shrsl.com/2vk8j)** is coated with enamel. The coating material is non-reactive, which eliminates any risk of iron toxicity, regardless of how minute. With the enameled cookware, you can cook every type of food you desire, including highly acidic ones, without the worry of adverse health effects. 

## What are the Advantages of Using Milo Enameled Dutch Ovens?

**Safety**

Enameled cast iron Dutch ovens guarantee healthy cooking. The enamel coating is inert and non-reactive, ensuring that no metallic residues leach into your food. 

As such, using enameled cast iron cookware gives you the liberty to cook a wide range of foods, including acidic ones such as tomatoes. 

**Non-Stick Surface** 

The enamel surface is smooth and non-stick, making it ideal for cooking different types of foods without the worry of burning/sticking. 

However, enamel nonstick surfaces are only effective when using medium heat. If you switch to high temperatures, you may require to apply oil regularly to prevent sticking. 

Regular cast iron cookware is better than enamel-coated ones when using a high cooking temperature. But the non-stick ability will be restored by applying vegetable oil.
