## What is a Forged Knife?

**Forged knives are more stable than stamped knives**. They are [made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife_making) from a flat and cut steel bar, heated and compressed to achieve the desired shape. 

Manufacturing the knives involves a lot of mechanical work and is dependent on trained artisans and sophisticated machines.

These manufacturing complexities and technicalities make **forged knives more expensive than stamped knives**. 

However, you can be sure that they are thicker and safer to use.

They retain the cutting edge for long, and you may only be required to sharpen them once or twice a year. 

## Features of a Forged Knife

Are you wondering how you can tell if a knife is forged or stamped? Well, [forged knives](https://www.houseofknives.com.au/blogs/news/choosing-between-forged-and-stamped-knives-whats-the-difference) have distinctive features that set them apart from the stamped ones. They include:

**Bolster**

Looking at a bolster’s presence in a knife is one of the easiest ways of determining whether it’s forged or not. But what is a bolster?

This is a wide lip that appears at the end of the blade before it joins with the handle. The thick junction provides a smooth transitioning from the knife blade to the handle. 

Additionally, this part of the knife adds some weight to the knife’s center, strengthening it and adding a balance. As such, you can be sure that this knife’s stability will guarantee a firmer grip and easier handling.

**Full/Partial Tang** 

A tang refers to the extension of the blade into the handle. Rivets support the tang to ensure that the knife blade is firm, thus guaranteeing durability. 

The tang can be full or partial. If complete, the metal blade will move to the end of the handle. 

However, this feature is not exclusively for forged knives. Some stamped knives incorporate tang to enhance usability and improve durability. 

**Weight**

Forged knives are heavier than stamped knives. This is because the knives are entirely made out of thick steel bars, which are honed, heated, and shaped to form heavy-duty knives. 

The knives are also thicker at the back while relatively taper at the front. Overall, manufacturing a forged is complicated, but it offers a better chance of integrating unique features and showcasing manufacturing creativity. 

## What is a Stamped Knife?

A stamped knife is made from a sheet of steel. They are then honed and heat-treated. As such, these are primarily the same texture and width, and they thus lack a bolster.

Additionally, stamped knives are lighter than forged knives, have low edge retention, and their longevity is generally lower than the forged ones. 

## Forged vs. Stamped Knives: What’s the Difference?

Like we’ve highlighted, the key differences between the main differences between the two knives can be classified into:

-   Functionality differences 
-   Manufacturing differences 
-   Quality differences 
-   Anatomy differences

-   **Labor Requirement.** Forged knives require more artisans to manufacture. Each of the manufacturing stages is labor-intensive, and the processes are relatively technical. Even when automation is implemented, it is in the form of robots and other relatively expensive machines.
-   **Raw Materials Use.** While forged knives use bars of steel that are cut, heated, and honed, the stamped are cut out from a large steel sheet. As such, manufacturing stamped knives is a breeze. 

Since manufacturing forged knives are more demanding than manufacturing stamped knives, the forged ones are pricier than the latter. 

### ***Quality Differences Between Forged and Stamped Knives***

Forged knives come with a bolster and are thicker towards the handle. This feature ensures that you don’t cut your hand easily because the blunt thicker area will prevent your hand from sliding into the sharpened section.
