A kitchen without lemon is incomplete! The small, rounded fruit has many [crucial roles](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Lemons) ranging from cleaning stained cookware to juicing. 

If you want to get the best from a lemon, you should extract its juice and store it in **[airtight containers](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-airtight-food-storage-containers//)**. This way, you can drink it, cook with it, or use it for cleaning any time you want.

But how much juice is in one lemon? Now that we fathom the benefits of juicing, you must understand the amount of juice you will get from one lemon. This knowledge will help you to plan on your purchases and make better-juicing decisions.

This article elaborates on how you can use a lemon juicer to extract juice from a lemon and how much juice to expect from it. Read on.

## **How Much Juice Is In One Lemon**

Each lemon yields approximately 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. As such, you’ll need 5-6 lemons to fill a cup.

**Read here about [how many tablespoons make one cup](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-many-ounces-in-a-quart//) (conversion)**

However, you must note that the lemon juice will be directly proportional to the size of the lemon. Here’s a summary of what to expect:

**Small Lemon (4 ounces) = 3 tablespoons of lemon juice**

**Medium Lemon (5 ounces) = 4 tablespoons of lemon juice**

**Large Lemon (6 ounces) = 5 tablespoons of lemon juice**

As such, you’ll need fewer than 5 large lemons to fill the cup. When visiting your grocery, you should know the approximate amount of juice you require to help you to calculate the number of lemons you need.

Fortunately, lemons have a relatively long shelf-life and overbuying will not necessarily result in a loss. 

## **How to Extract Lemon Juice at Home**

If you’re keen on getting the most juice out of your lemon, you should follow a few proven techniques as outlined below:

**Soften Your Lemon**

You must soften your lemon to ease the pressing. To achieve this, **you should place your lemon in warm water for 30 minutes**. AVOID boiling the lemon. 

**Roll the Lemon Slightly Before Cutting It**

Applying a little pressure on the surface of your lemon is a sure way of softening the lemon, thus guaranteeing more juice. 

Rolling the lemon on the surface of your chopping board, or any hard surface will help loosen the membrane in readiness for juice release. However, never beat the lemon so tough to avoid cracking it, which may result in contamination. 

**Heat the Lemon in a Microwave, Gently**

Heating your WHOLE lemon in a microwave for 20 seconds will soften the membranes holding the juice. As such, only a little pressure will result in incredible juice volumes. Never cut the lemon before placing it into the microwave.

**Cut Your Lemon Lengthwise as Opposed to Widthwise**

Cutting your lemon lengthwise will expose more of the fruit’s interior, thus increasing the surface that comes into contact with the pressure. 

Once cut, you can use your fork to loosen up the membranes. Place a container beneath the lemon, insert the fork’s tines, and twist until the juice starts coming out. You should then press it fully using your hands.

**Use a Lemon Squeezer**

There are many [lemon squeezers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_squeezer) you can try out. These crucial kitchen gadgets offer an ergonomic grip, thus allowing you to press the lemon hard enough to extract all the juice.

**Here’s a guide on [how to use a lemon juicer effectively](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-use-a-lemon-juicer//)**

The lemon juicers can either be electric or manual. While electric ones are more convenient, they are also pricey.
