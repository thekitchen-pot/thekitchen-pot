However, selecting the best [espresso machines](https://www.wikihow.com/Choose-an-Espresso-Machine) can be hectic. This is worse when you do not have the slightest idea of what you should consider when shopping.

If you’ve found yourself in such shopping difficulties, then you shouldn’t worry! This article will outline the factors you should consider before settling for your best espresso machine.

### **Factors to Consider When Buying the Best Espresso Machines** 

-   **Ease of Use**

How easy is it to use your best espresso machine? Well, when purchasing your espresso machine, you should always consider your previous brewing experience. 

If you have never been a barista or operated an espresso machine, then you should settle for the super-automatic models.

Both automatic and semi-automatic espresso machines  have some functions automated. That way, you’ll have an easy time brewing your espresso. 

-   **Material Used in Construction**

The materials used in the construction of your best espresso machine will determine its durability and appearance. 

While they may be a bit pricey, stainless steel espresso machines are relatively durable. However, you can also choose an espresso machine that combines both metal and plastic.

Additionally, you should always consider your taste and preferences. If you’d love your best espresso machine to match the aesthetics of your kitchen, then you should choose one with your favorite colors.

-   **Size**

The size of your best espresso machine will determine how easy it is to carry it around. If you love outdoors, you may require a small-sized and portable espresso machine.

Also, the size affects your storage ability. Always consider the size of your kitchen storage space before settling for your best espresso machine. 

-   **Capacity**

What is the size of your best espresso machine storage container? If you have a big family, you may want to consider an espresso machine that can hold up to 6 cups at one moment.

On the contrary, it wouldn’t be necessary to have an overly big espresso machine if you have a family of two!

-   **Ease of Cleaning**

How easy is it to [clean your best espresso machine](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-an-Espresso-Machine)? These machines require constant and vigorous cleaning exercises. As such, getting an espresso machine with an easy cleaning procedure will be a plus for you. 

-   **Pressure Levels**

Pressurized hot water will produce foam and froth, which is a crucial element of an espresso drink. When the water passes through grounded coffee beans, you can be sure that you’ll get an irresistible espresso. 

To achieve the best results, we recommend that your best espresso machine should have 15-17 bars. However, you can choose one with as low as 9 bars depending on your preferences. 

-   **Automatic Milk Frother**

Do you want your best espresso machine to have an automatic frother? If yes, then you should be ready to clean the machine with hot water after every use.

However, the automatic milk frother will guarantee a quick milk froth and it eliminates the need to preheat the milk. 

## **Best Espresso Machines – Coffee Beans vs. Pods**

When buying the best espresso machine, you should always consider whether it allows the use of pods. 

All espresso machines will require fine coffee. While many people prefer freshly ground dark roast coffee beans, others detest the work associated with the grinding process. 

If you don’t want to grind the coffee beans at home, you should always buy a pod compatible espresso machine. While they are likely to be more expensive, they’ll offer diversity and allow you to make irresistible espresso even when you don’t have coffee beans.

## **Best Espresso Machines -The Bottom Line**

Do you want to transform your coffee making process for the better? Well, there is no better way to achieve that than buying the best espresso machine.

These machines are tailor-made to ensure that you achieve the best taste latte, espresso, and cappuccino. It comes in different variations including manual, semi-automatic, and super-automatic. 

As such, you can always choose that which suits you best depending on your experience level. If you’ve ever been a barista, you’ll not have a problem operating the manual espresso machine.
