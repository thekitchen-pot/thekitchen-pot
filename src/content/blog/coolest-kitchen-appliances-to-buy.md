Did you know that the average person spends approximately 30 minutes daily in the kitchen? A survey conducted by the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf) shows that Americans spend more time cooking than in any other activity. 

This data emphasizes the importance that Americans attach to food and drink preparation.

Interestingly, the time spent in the kitchen remains more or less the same despite the reduction of overall time allocated to household activities as people become busier to meet the bills.

In 2019, the time that Americans allocated to house chores dropped to 1.78 hours from 2.25 hours in 2015.

Despite the drop, the time used in the kitchen increased to more than 35 minutes, taking the largest chunk of time allocated for house chores.

It’s evident that the kitchen is a special place for Americans. As such, you should always endeavor to make it a lively place. You wouldn’t want to spend more than 30 minutes in a boring environment, right?

Well, the surest way to enliven your kitchen is by purchasing helpful appliances that’ll make your work in the kitchen easier. This article lists 16 cute kitchen appliances to buy and why you should have them in your kitchen!

Here are a few of the coolest kitchen appliances for the money:

### **1\. Sous Vide Power Precision Cooker**

![Must-Have Kitchen Appliance](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

Sous Vide Precision Cooker is a modern cooking appliance that allows you to cook your meals in vacuum-sealed bags. 

It ensures that you achieve moist and flavorful meals that would easily pass the test of the best food enthusiasts.

It uses slow-cooking techniques to ensure that your food is neither undercooked or overcooked. Also, this approach ensures that you get even doneness on your meat for optimal enjoyment of your meals. 

Operating your best sous vide cooker is a breeze. It has push buttons to control the time and temperature. Most of them are Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth enabled to ensure that you can monitor the cooking progress remotely. 

Even better, using sous vide to cook uses less salts and oils, which results in relatively healthier meals. It doesn’t matter whether you want to cook your turkey, poached salmon, or burgers, this kitchen appliance will fit the bill. 

When shopping, you should always ensure that the sous vide has a low water alert feature, long enough power cord, water circulator pump, and removable skirt for ease of cleaning.

On this, we recommend that you buy the [**Anova Culinary AN500-US00 Sous Vide Precision Cooker (WiFi), 1000 Watts | Anova App Included, Black and Silver**](https://www.amazon.com/Anova-Culinary-AN500-US00-Precision-Included/dp/B07WQ4M5TS?tag=kitchenpot-20)

-   Strong Wi-Fi connectivity 
-   Heats up pretty fast – Delivers 1000 watts/ 110 volts 
-   Long enough cord to allow you to cook on the countertop even when the power source is relatively far

### **2\. Instant Pot**

![Coolest Smart Kitchen Appliances](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

If you love convenience and speed when cooking, then buying the best instant pot is the best decision you can ever make!

It works as a slow cooker, pressure cooker, yogurt maker, rice cooker, among many other functions. 

As such, we can safely say that an instant pot is the most versatile appliance you can have in your kitchen. 

Even better, the smart device comes with an LCD with simple push menu options to allow you to select the temperature and timings that suit your specific dish.

It has sensors that help in regulating temperature and pressure. Once the cooking is complete, the instant pot will auto shut, thus eliminating any risk of burning the food. 

To get the best results when using an instant pot, we recommend that you purchase [**Instant Pot Duo Nova Pressure Cooker 7 in 1, 6 Qt**](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-One-Touch-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/dp/B07RCNHTLS?tag=kitchenpot-20)**.**

**Why We Like Duo Nova Instant Pot**

-   7-in-1 Appliance. It works as a Pressure cooker, steamer, sauté pan, food warmer, slow cooker, rice cooker, and a yogurt maker. 
-   Comes with a microprocessor to monitor and adjust the temperature, time, and pressure
-   Delivers uniform food doneness 70% faster than conventional cooking techniques 

### **3\. Iced Tea Maker**

![smart kitchen appliances](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

When it’s summer, it’s time to enjoy your iced tea. However, preparing can be such a pain!

If you desperately need that iced cold tea, then you should invest in an iced tea maker. This unique kitchen appliance comes in different sizes ranging from a single cup to multiple cups.

This flexibility ensures that you only choose an iced tea maker that suits your needs and desires. 

It works by brewing bagged or loose tea then dripping it into a pitcher with ice. The ice cools it down giving you a cold refreshing beverage fit for any hot day. 

Points to note when shopping for the best-iced tea maker include:

-   A removable pitcher for ease of cleaning and drink storage
-   Automatic shut-off/ automated operations
-   LCD-lit control panel 
-   Ease of infusion when you want flavored tea

Based on these factors, we recommend two main brands: 

-   [**Mr. Coffee TM75 Iced Tea Maker**](https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-2-Quart-Iced-Maker/dp/B00005OTXI?tag=kitchenpot-20)
-   [**Takeya Iced Tea Maker with Patented Flash Chill Technology**](https://www.amazon.com/Takeya-Maker-Patented-Flash-Technology/dp/B0095ZBJT2?tag=kitchenpot-20)

Both of these appliances are BPA-free and highly efficient. If you choose a different brand, ensure that you check that it is BPA-free for guaranteed safety. 

### **4\. Espresso Machine/ Coffee Maker**

![Best Kitchen Appliances for Gifts ](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

Enjoying a cup of coffee offers unmatched satisfaction. It will help you to cut your visits to your favorite coffee shop while ensuring that you get your ideal quality of coffee, espresso, or cappuccino. 

To get a more refreshing coffee brewing experience, we recommend that you buy an espresso machine that comes with a grinder. This will enable you to use freshly ground beans, thus giving a better tasting beverage. 

An espresso machine will use less water and minimum pressure bars. This shortens the time required to make your favorite beverage. Additionally, it results in thicker and creamier coffee. 

There are several types of espresso makers in the market today. You can choose to purchase a fully-automated, super-automatic, automatic, semi-automatic, or manual machine. 

If you’re not an expert in making coffee, we advise that you avoid the [manual espresso makers](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/kitchen-dining/coffee/) since they are a bit technical. 

We recommend that you shop for [**Breville BES870XL Barista Express Espresso Machine, Brushed Stainless Steel.**](https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BES870XL-Barista-Express-Espresso/dp/B00CH9QWOU?tag=kitchenpot-20)

**Why We Like Breville Espresso Machine**

-   Has an integrated grinder 
-   Digital temperature control 
-   Comes with micro-foam milk texturing 
-   Hands-free operation with a water capacity of 67 oz

### **5\. Hand Mixer**

![Coolest Kitchen Appliances to Buy](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

This kitchen appliance is particularly important if you love baking. It allows you to mix your ingredients with unmatched uniformity. This way, you can rest assured that you’ll bake high-quality products. 

Hand mixers are less expensive than stand mixers but will help you achieve your desired goal, especially when you want to bake a few products.

Since you’ll be required to hold the mixer for long when mixing, you should choose one with ergonomic handles. This will guarantee comfort as you mix your ingredients. 

Additionally, you should always consider the attachments that come along with the mixer. An ideal hand mixer should have a flat beater, dough hook, balloon whisk, and flex edge beater. 

We recommend that you get [**Hamilton Beach 6-Speed Electric Hand Mixer**](https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-62682RZ-Mixer-Snap/dp/B001CH0ZLE?tag=kitchenpot-20) to enjoy the best mixing results.

-   250 watts enough to mix all types of baking ingredients
-   Highly versatile attachments
-   Includes a Snap-On storage case

### **6\. Immersion Blender**

![Coolest Kitchen Appliances ](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

An immersion blender is a real deal when you want to make soups and sauces with unmatched convenience. 

The versatile hand-held blenders have a motor at one end and sharp blades on the other. This way, you’ll be able to blend your ingredients comfortably inside the pot, thus eliminating the need of transferring them.

Even more interesting, immersion blenders come with varying strengths. If you get a powerful one, it can undertake complicated tasks such as mashing potatoes and crushing ice.

Our top pick for this category is **Mueller Austria Ultra-Stick 500 Watt 9-Speed Immersion Multi-Purpose Hand Blender Heavy Duty Copper Motor Brushed 304 Stainless Steel With Whisk, Milk Frother Attachments.**

### **7\. Rice Cooker**

![Best Rice Cooker](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

If you want to enjoy cooking your rice – whether brown or white – you should consider buying the best rice cooker.

A rice cooker helps you to boil or steam rice with much precision than when using an ordinary pot. It has a thermostat that measures and controls temperature to ensure that your rice does not overheat/overcook.

We recommend that you buy [**BLACK+DECKER RC506 6-Cup Cooked/3-Cup Uncooked Rice Cooker and Food Steamer**](https://www.amazon.com/DECKER-RC506-Cooked-Uncooked-Steamer/dp/B016Y8JSK4?tag=kitchenpot-20) for guaranteed results.

This Amazon best seller is lightweight, effective, and highly versatile. It includes a food steaming basket and an automatic keep warm feature.

Additionally, most rice cookers have an LCD control panel to allow you to select the time and the temperature you need, depending on the type and quantity of rice (brown or white).

### **8\. Electric Can Openers**

An electric can opener is an absolute necessity, especially if you’re a fan of canned food. It eliminates the hassles of opening the cans manually, which may lead to cuts and injuries.

Interestingly, most electric can openers are designed to accommodate the elderly and individuals with painful joint conditions.

All that you’ll need to do is fix it in place and switch on the power button!

However, you must be keen to ensure that you only choose a can opener that does not become too messy when opening cans. This way, you’ll have an easy time cleaning and maintaining it. 

On this, we recommend that you get yourself a **Hamilton Beach Smooth Touch Electric Automatic Can Opener.**

![Coolest Kitchen Appliances to Buy](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

**Why We Recommend** [**Hamilton Beach Smooth Electric Can Opener**](https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-76607-Smooth-Opener/dp/B000SAS5GI?tag=kitchenpot-20)

-   Unlike other can openers, the Hamilton Beach cuts along the side of the container as opposed to the top. This reduces contact with the food and eliminates spillage.
-   It has an easy touch opening lever making it the best fit for the elderly and arthritis patients
-   Comes with a convenient pair of scissors for opening bags 
-   Unique chrome and black design to complement your kitchen’s décor

### **9\. A Set of Knife** 

![ Best Knife Set](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

A knife set is a must-have for any serious chef. Knives make cutting, dicing, and slicing easy a blissful undertaking. 

However, you must always ensure that your knives remain sharp to avoid injuries associated with using blunt knives.

Any ideal knife set should contain different types of knives including a chef’s knife, utility knife, serrated knife, santoku knife, slicing knife, carving knife, steak knife, and a paring knife. 

On this, we have 2 equally good knives: The [**Home Hero Stainless Steel Knife Set**](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Knife-Set-Block/dp/B075MD55N1?tag=kitchenpot-20) and the [**Master Maison 19-Piece Premium Kitchen Knife Set With Wooden Block**](https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Knife-Block-Master-Maison/dp/B082VPG997?tag=kitchenpot-20). 

I had difficulties defining the winner after using both. But I like the ergonomic handles of the Master Maison brand coupled with its highly aesthetic wooden block.

The Home Hero brand wins on versatility. It comes with a 2-stage knife sharpener, a pair of kitchen scissors, and a peeler. 

Overall, the choice between the two brands boils down to personal preferences. Choose that which will serve you the best! 

### **10\. Knife Sharpener**

Having the best knife is all glamorous until it becomes blunt. All of a sudden, what used to make dicing and cutting a breeze will become a source of pain. 

Considering that almost all meal prep activities demand that you have a knife, you cannot afford to have a dull knife in your [**lazy Susan organizer.**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/8-best-lazy-susan-organizers-for-your-kitchen//)

Fortunately, getting the best knife sharpener does not have to cost an arm and a leg! There are numerous knife sharpeners starting from as little as $20. 

**Check here for the [best knife sharpeners to buy](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-knife-sharpener//)**

Before you step out to shop, you should know that there are two main types of knife sharpeners:

-   Electric Knife Sharpeners
-   Manual Knife Sharpeners

Electric sharpeners are easy to use since they require little input from your end. Also, they are ideal for the elderly and people suffering from arthritis and other inflammatory joint conditions.

However, electric vs. manual knife sharpener analysis shows that you’ll have to part with more dollars if you opt for the electric one – but it is worth every coin you spend on it. 

We recommend that you consider **Chef’sChoice 130 Professional Electric Knife Sharpening Station for Straight and Serrated Knives Diamond Abrasives and Precision Angle Guides Made in the USA, 3-Stages, Platinum.**

![Best Electric Knife Sharpener](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

### **11\. Mandoline Slicers**

![Best Mandoline Slicer](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)
