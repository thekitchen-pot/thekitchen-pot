## Instant Pot vs Ninja Foodi – A Comprehensive Analysis

### **What is an Instant Pot?**

An instant pot is a multi-functional pressure cooker that can cook a lot of meals ranging from roasts to chicken to desserts. Even better, these appliances use much less time than most other cooking appliances.

They have different characteristics, each one uniquely designated to help you in accomplishing specific activity, such as air frying, steaming, searing, broiling, and baking.

### **How Does an Instant Pot Work?**

Instant pots are a brand of electric pressure cookers. They [work](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-an-Instant-Pot) by creating heat under a tight seal, so the temperature is much higher than the boiling point of water and the steam can’t escape.

The steam cooks food much more quickly than traditional stovetop or oven cooking.

### **Instant Pots Pros and Cons**

**Instant Pot Pros**

Have you found yourself forgetting to remove your meat from the freezer to prepare for dinner? Or even ordering pizza due to time shortage?

Well, that shouldn’t worry you anymore!

With an instant pot, you can cook your frozen meat without having to do a quick thaw in the microwave. Even more impressive, you can cook all your types of meat like your chicken, pork, or beef from a frozen state and still get tasty food within a reasonable time.

These unique pots have the potential of saving up to 70% of your energy. They reach temperatures above boiling, and the higher the temperature, the faster the food will cook.

With an instant pot, one-pot meals are possible. You can insert dishes that are microwave-safe into the instant pot and layer foods to be cooked all at once.

Removing hot steam can be quite scary, especially when it’s your first time. But instant pots make it easy for you.

Most instant pots have an easy release that’s located away from the steam pot. This ensures you’ll never suffer from the hand burns even if you don’t use any protection or wear a glove.

**Instant Pots Cons**

An instant pot is an electronic appliance, and depending on which type you have there can be technical problems and error messages. 

Other issues you might experience include: sealing issues, venting issues, delayed timer issues, and liquids spewing up out of the steam vent.

Also, you need steam to cook your food. Unfortunately, if you don’t pay attention to setting the vent properly, this slows your cooking time. This is because the steam escapes rather than build up inside.

With an instant pot, dairy curdles under pressure. So make sure you remember to add milk or cream after the recipe has been cooked under pressure.
