## **Best Mini Fridge for Beer -Buyers Guide** 

Buying your best [mini fridge](https://www.wise-geek.com/what-is-a-mini-bar.htm) is, without a doubt, a worthwhile investment. It offers a quick and straightforward way to keep your beer cold! 

However, selecting the best mini fridge for beer can be such a hassle. This is especially so if you have no idea the features you should be looking out for. 

If you’ve found yourself in such a quagmire, then you shouldn’t worry. This section will offer a comprehensive guide that’ll help you select the best mini fridge for beer like a pro. 

## **Best Mini Fridge for Beer – Which is the Best Cooling System for You?**

When selecting your best mini fridge for beer, you must always check its cooling systems for guaranteed efficacy. The two major cooling systems include:

### **Thermoelectric** 

In this system, the cooling effect is generated by a pump-powered heat source instead of a liquid coolant. They incorporate a fan that must keep running to keep the fridge cool. 

**What are the Benefits of Thermoelectric Cooling?**

This cooling system works best in small spaces and uses less electricity compared to other methods of refrigeration. 

Additionally, this system is environmentally friendly since it does not use chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s) or hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which would otherwise contribute to ozone layer destruction.

Finally, thermoelectric cooling is silent. It produces little noise when compared to the compressor type. However, those that incorporate a fan may produce some manageable noise. 

**What are the Disadvantages of Thermoelectric Cooling?**

When used in large spaces, this method of cooling can be costly. In such cases, you’ll need more ceramic plates to cover the larger area, which will translate to a higher requirement of electricity. 

Also, the thermoelectric cooling system depends entirely on the surrounding temperatures. It can only bring the temperature down to a certain degree but not to sub-freezing standards. 

For example, if your best mini fridge for beer (TEC version) has the capacity to bring down temperature by 20 degrees, then it’ll keep the internal temperatures at 15 degrees (if the prevailing temperature is 35 degrees). As such, you may never get significantly cold beers during summer!

Finally, thermoelectric coolers never dehumidify the surrounding air. The moisture content remains in your fridge. While this may not be an entirely bad thing for drinks, storing solid food substances may lead to a mess. 

### **Compressor Cooling System**

In this system, a compressor will pump vaporized liquid through a coil, thus ensuring that you maintain your drinks cold for long every time it’s super hot outside. 

However, this system makes lots of noise! As such, it may not be ideal if you want to store it in your bedroom – it’ll surely cause you sleepless nights!

## **Thermoelectric Cooling vs. Compressor Cooling – Which is Right for Me?**

Only choose a thermostatic cooler if:

-   You want to keep your best mini fridge for beer in a room with steady temperature all time
-   Wish to have minimal noise when cooling

On the contrary, you should choose compressor if:

-   You live in places with extreme temperature conditions
-   You want to chill your beers
-   You’re fine with a noisy refrigerator

## **Best Mini Fridge for Beer – Other Factors to Consider When Shopping**

Here are factors that you should never ignore when purchasing your best mini fridge for beer:

-   **Capacity**

Mini fridges for beer are not of universal size; their capacity differs significantly. As such, you must always evaluate your needs before selecting your best mini fridge for beer. 

How many beers would you like to store in the refrigerator? 

Always answer this question with utmost honesty before choosing one. This way, you can be sure that you’ll never have space strains. 

-   **Temperature Control**

While some mini fridges for beer allow you to set your ideal temperatures, others rely on a numbered dial that gives a range (the higher number is always the coldest). The more precise your temperatures, the better it’ll be for you. 

-   **Adjustability of the Shelves**

How adjustable are the shelves? Can you change the layout on the interior to suit your bottle sizes?

When selecting your best mini fridge for beer, you should choose one with adjustable shelves – it can be made of glass, chrome, or metal. Choose based on your preferences. 

-   **Appearance**

Who wouldn’t want a stylish mini fridge to complete the elegance of their house? Well, you should check the material used in construction. Is it glass or metal? Is it coloured?

Only choose those which add a stylish touch to your space. 

Additionally, always consider mobility. If it’s too fragile, it may not be ideal, especially when moving it. 

## **Best Mini Fridge for Beer -The Bottom Line**

Drinking a cold beer during summer brings a refreshing feeling. However, you need to get the best mini fridge for beer if you’re to get cold and chilled beers!

There many brands for the best mini fridge for beer. As such, you should always research widely before selecting your best mini fridge for beer. One of the critical factors that you should never ignore is the cooling system.
