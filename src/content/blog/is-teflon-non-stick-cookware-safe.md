TEST visibility of the post:  Teflon, the brand name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), has been a staple in kitchens worldwide for decades, prized for its non-stick surface that makes cooking and cleaning easier. 

However, questions about its safety persist, especially as research continues to uncover potential health and environmental risks. This article explores the safety of Teflon non-stick cookware, compares it to stainless steel, examines why chefs often avoid it, and discusses what you should do if your Teflon pans are peeling.

## **Understanding Teflon: What Is It?**

Teflon is a synthetic fluoropolymer known for its non-reactive, non-stick, and nearly frictionless surface. Its primary use in cookware is to prevent food from sticking, allowing for low-fat cooking and easy cleaning. The non-stick convenience is especially valued for delicate foods like eggs and pancakes.

## **Is Teflon Non-Stick Cookware Safe?**

Modern Teflon and PFOA Teflon cookware manufactured today is generally considered safe for everyday home use, provided it is not overheated. The main concern in the past was the use of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the manufacturing process, a chemical linked to several health issues. 

However, since 2013, Teflon cookware sold in the US and many other countries has been PFOA-free.

## **Risks of Overheating**

The safety of Teflon largely depends on how it is used. When Teflon-coated pans are heated above 500°F (260°C), the PTFE coating can begin to decompose, releasing toxic fumes. Inhaling these fumes can cause polymer fume fever—commonly called "Teflon flu"—with symptoms like chills, fever, headache, and body aches. While these symptoms are temporary in humans, the fumes can be fatal to pet birds due to their sensitive respiratory systems.

At temperatures above 500°F (260°C), Teflon coatings on nonstick cookware start to break down, releasing toxic chemicals into the air.
