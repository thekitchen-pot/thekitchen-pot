## **What is an Airtight Food Storage Container?**

The best airtight food storage [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container) are designed in a way that no air can enter or leave the container once you shut the lids tightly.

As such, you can be sure that they’ll help you to prevent your food from developing freezer burn, getting soggy, and picking odors from other foodstuffs around.

## How Do Airtight Containers Work?

The best airtight food storage containers have many other benefits such as:

-   The best airtight storage containers prevent your food from going bad. They keep microorganisms, like germs and bad bacteria, away from your food.
-   The best airtight food storage containers do not allow oxygen (air) inside the container. This means that the food will not come into contact with air, thus preventing oxidation which would otherwise cause rancidity.

## **How Do You Know If a Container is Airtight?**

To get the ideal results from your best airtight food storage containers, you must test whether they are indeed airtight before you start using them. But how do you test whether the containers are airtight? Here are 2 unique methods:

-   Fill the container with water and ensure that you dry it completely – especially around the lids. Hold it upside down and wait for 2-3 minutes. If it’s airtight, the container should remain dry all through.
-   Use moisture-detecting crystals. After adding the crystals into the container, ensure that you seal it entirely. Dip it in water for 2 minutes. If it leaks, the crystals will change from blue to pink. If they remain blue, then your container is airtight.

Whichever method you choose, just ensure that you confirm the status of your lids and whether they can keep moisture and air at bay. If you detect any defect, you should consult the manufacturer/supplier immediately for a replacement (if the warranty provides for it).

To make things easier for you, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide on how to shop for the best airtight food storage containers to suit your likes and preferences. 

### **Factors to Consider when Buying the Best Airtight Food Containers** 

-   **Shape**

However, we recommend the rectangular ones with straight edges as they take up less space in your **[lazy Susan Organizers](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/8-best-lazy-susan-organizers-for-your-kitchen//)**, cabinets, and fridge.

-   **Construction Material** 

The most common materials used in the construction of the best airtight food storage containers are plastic and glass. 

Glass containers are most preferred as they have more uses and can be used in the oven. However, they are not the best for outdoors as they’re heavier and fragile.

However, you must check to ensure that your best plastic airtight food containers are BPA-free. This way, you’ll be assured of safety. 

-   **Lids**

Lids are of different types: some have clasps on the sides while others require a simple press down to close. However, the most preferred lids are the ones without clasps as they’re thinner and easy to store up.

On the other hand, the ones with clasps come with an extra source of leak-safety.

Additionally, metallic lids are the best if you intend to use a **[magnetic knife strip](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-magnetic-knife-strip//)** to organize them in your cabinet. They will attach on the underside of the magnetic strip, thus making storage a breeze.
