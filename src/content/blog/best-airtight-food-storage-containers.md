Are you having trouble maintaining your food items as fresh as you bought them? Or have you had your cookies go soft and [tasteless](https://www.yuppiechef.com/spatula/common-cookie-problems-and-how-to-avoid-them/) just because you left them exposed in the open air? 

As a professional baker, I must admit that I enjoy my biscuits and cookies while they’re fresh and crunchy. But how do I achieve this? 

Well, it’s easy.

You can keep your cookies fresh and crunchy by storing them in the best airtight food storage containers.  Here is a comprehensive guide on all that you need to know when shopping for the best airtight food storage containers for the money. Read on for more details.

## **What Makes a Container Truly Airtight?**

An airtight container isn’t just about breathable silicone seals or click-lock lids, it’s the air-free pocket inside where spoiling slows to a crawl. The truly airtight models feature:

* Rubber or silicone gaskets pressed flush against the lid
* Multi-point clasps or snap-fit lids that lock securely
* Lab-certified materials that resist warping and degradation
* Stackable, seal-maintaining design so no warping under weight

As such, you can be sure that they’ll help you to prevent your food from developing freezer burn, getting soggy, and picking odors from other foodstuffs around.

## How Do Airtight Containers Work?

The best airtight food storage containers have many other benefits such as:

* The best airtight storage containers prevent your food from going bad. They keep microorganisms, like germs and bad bacteria, away from your food.
* The best airtight food storage containers do not allow oxygen (air) inside the container. This means that the food will not come into contact with air, thus preventing oxidation which would otherwise cause rancidity.

## **How Do You Know If a Container is Airtight?**

To get the ideal results from your best airtight food storage containers, you must test whether they are indeed airtight before you start using them. But how do you test whether the containers are airtight? Here are 2 unique methods:

* Fill the container with water and ensure that you dry it completely – especially around the lids. Hold it upside down and wait for 2-3 minutes. If it’s airtight, the container should remain dry all through.
* Use moisture-detecting crystals. After adding the crystals into the container, ensure that you seal it entirely. Dip it in water for 2 minutes. If it leaks, the crystals will change from blue to pink. If they remain blue, then your container is airtight.

Whichever method you choose, just ensure that you confirm the status of your lids and whether they can keep moisture and air at bay. If you detect any defect, you should consult the manufacturer/supplier immediately for a replacement (if the warranty provides for it).

## **Best Airtight Food Storage Containers-Buying Guide**

If you want to purchase the best airtight food storage containers, you must be careful to assess all the attributes. This will allow you to get that which will meet all your needs comfortably.

In the buying guide section, we’ll evaluate all that you need to consider when shopping around for the best airtight food storage containers.

## **How to Choose the Best Airtight Food Containers**

Choosing the best airtight food storage containers can be a bit demanding, especially due to the wide range of products available in the market today. 

To make things easier for you, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide on how to shop for the best airtight food storage containers to suit your likes and preferences. 

### **Factors to Consider when Buying the Best Airtight Food Containers** 

* **Shape**

When shopping for the best airtight food storage containers, you may find that most of them come in rectangular or round shapes. While this may appear like a non-issue, it affects the kind of food you can store in the containers significantly. 

The rectangular-shaped food storage containers with straight edges stack uniformly, making them meats storage.

On the other hand, the round ones are ideal for liquids, and salads.

However, we recommend the rectangular ones with straight edges as they take up less space in your **[lazy Susan Organizers](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/8-best-lazy-susan-organizers-for-your-kitchen//)**, cabinets, and fridge.

* **Construction Material** 

The most common materials used in the construction of the best airtight food storage containers are plastic and glass. 

Glass containers are most preferred as they have more uses and can be used in the oven. However, they are not the best for outdoors as they’re heavier and fragile.

On the other hand, plastic ones are ideal for storing items in the refrigerator. Additionally, you may consider these containers if you use them to carry food items since they can’t break even with a fall.

However, you must check to ensure that your best plastic airtight food containers are BPA-free. This way, you’ll be assured of safety. 

* **Lids**

Lids are of different types: some have clasps on the sides while others require a simple press down to close. However, the most preferred lids are the ones without clasps as they’re thinner and easy to store up.

On the other hand, the ones with clasps come with an extra source of leak-safety.

Additionally, metallic lids are the best if you intend to use a **[magnetic knife strip](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-magnetic-knife-strip//)** to organize them in your cabinet. They will attach on the underside of the magnetic strip, thus making storage a breeze.

Glass jars do not only help you in maintaining freshness in your food, but they’re also aesthetically appealing.

Additionally, the glass jars are safe for storing foods as they’re free from any chemicals. They either come fitted with wooden lids or a clamp. This ensures the containers are well-sealed and fully airtight.

* **Plastic Airtight Containers**

In most households, the most common food storage containers are plastic. This is because they’re cheap and readily available.

When buying plastic containers, you should always ensure that the containers are BPA-free. This is to ensure that the food being stored in the containers is safe for human consumption.

Lately, most plastics available in the market are microwave and dishwasher safe. This means that you can comfortably use them in your kitchen.

* **Acrylic Food Storage Containers**

Acrylic is a strong, transparent, and stiff material used in making different forms of storage containers. It has glass-like properties but weighs half the weight of the glass. Acrylic food storage containers are ideal if you need a transparent and lightweight storage options.
