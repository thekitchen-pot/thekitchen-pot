## Gotham Steel Smokeless Grill Review – Is It Really Smokeless?

Well, this grill scores averagely on this parameter. You’ll **get manageable smoke initially, but it will diminish as you proceed with your grilling**. 

As such, the Gotham grill is your forte if you love smokeless cooking environments.

*Gotham Steel Smokeless Grill is **NOT** 100% smokeless. However, the initial smokes will **diminish with time***.

But how does a smokeless grill work?

You’d expect that grilling meat and preparing your BBQ would yield lots of smoke. Well, that doesn’t happen when you’re using a smokeless grill.

Here’s why:

![How Smokeless Grills Work](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

-   **Use of Smokeless Technology.** Smokeless grills have an electric fan that aids in warding off smoke. 
-   **It Has a Nonstick Grate.** The grill grates have a ceramic-titanium cover that enables you to grill your food without sticking to the surface. 
-   **A Removable Drip Tray.** When cooking fatty meals, it is possible that oil drips from your food. If allowed to remain on the food, it will heat up, resulting in clouds of smoke. The Gotham grill has a **removable tray where the oil** is collected, thus eliminating any smoking chance. You can add a little water to the tray, thus preventing the oil from heating up.

## Why Gotham Steel Smokeless Grill is Unique

**Easy-to-Heat Grilling Grate**

This appliance comes with a unique grilling grate that heats within a short time (**approximately 5 minutes**). The grill grate heats evenly, ensuring that your food cooks uniformly. 

**Scratch-Proof Surface**

The cooking surface of this grill is hardened with titanium. The titanium-ceramic cover is scratch-resistant, thus guaranteeing durability. 

This feature makes it easy for you to use any cleaning agent (even the abrasive ones) in case of a stain.

**A Unique Construction Technology** 

Gotham electric smokeless grill uses the **Ti-Ceramic technology** to [infuse](https://healthy-cookware.com/what-is-titanium-cookware-really-made-of/) titanium into its ceramic coating. This construction method yields a non-porous and non-stick cooking surface. The surface is non-reactive and safe for grilling. 

Besides the convenience, the **Ti-Ceramic concept offers other benefits**, including:

-   **Durability.** The coating is abrasion-resistant. The titanium infusion ensures wear-resistance, thus ensuring longevity. However, you should avoid using excessively sharp knives or spatulas since they may scratch the surface a little.
-   **Less Oil Requirement.** Since the surface is non-stick, you will not require oil to cook your meals. Just place them on the grill grate and enjoy the grilling process. 
-   **Ease of Cleaning.** The titanium infused grill grate is easy to clean. All you need is a piece of cloth and warm soapy water to complete the cleaning process. **We advise against using a dishwasher.**

**Drip Pan Cools Oil Down**

When you are cooking oily food, you’re likely to experience more smoke as the oil heats up. To remedy this, the Gotham steel grill has a drip pan that collects all the fat from your food, thus preventing it from heating up.

**Easy to Use**

The Gotham smokeless grill and griddle has a pretty straightforward control panel. It offers a **near smokeless** cooking experience inside your kitchen. Its cooking is relatively large, enabling you to cook tasty meals for your entire family to enjoy. 

It has four cooking settings that are simple-to-adjust. This feature enables you to set the temperature l**ow, medium, medium-high, and high depending on the meal that you’re cooking.** 

**A Detailed Cookbook**

The Gotham smokeless grill comes with a detailed cookbook that gives cooking tips. It enumerates all the foods that you can make using the grill, the ideal temperature, and the cooking time for each food item. 

As such, this grill is ideal even for beginners. All you’ll need is to prepare your ingredients and follow the instructions as highlighted in the cookbook!
