## **What Is The Difference Between A Food Processor And A Blender?**

### **1\. Blenders**

A blender is generally used for light foods, and it’s used to prepare smoothies and [protein shakes](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-blender-for-protein-shakes//). However, a relatively large blender can handle pretty hard foods just like a blender.

They are a great addition to any kitchen, and if you lack one, then your kitchen is incomplete.

Additionally, there exist immersion blenders which further simplifies smoothies making process. But what is an immersion blender?

Immersion blenders are compact, inexpensive, lightweight, and are easy to store and clean, making them the perfect pick for cooks or chefs who lacks large storage space.

#### **Features of Blenders** 

-   **Reversing Blade System**

Most blenders have a reversing technology that assists in alternating the blender’s blades forward and backward. This draws the ingredients down slowly and repeatedly enhancing a smooth blending process.

Additionally, the reversing blade features a stainless steel construction to crush the ice with a powerful motor.

Furthermore, blenders are designed with a metallic drive that’s durable to enhance longevity. This feature functions amazingly, producing incredible results.

-   **Back-lit Display Is Easy To Read** 

This is essential in helping you in making various selections on the display. Also, some blenders have a bigger display backlit that shows the low and high rotations which allow you to monitor the blender with the touch of buttons.

More so, the pre-programmed settings include time and function, and that’s the beauty of an easy to read backlit.

-   **Motor Size**

With blenders, motor power is an essential factor to consider when blending fibrous and hard vegetables. Average kitchen blenders have 300 to 600 power watts, with the top-performing blenders whooping up to 1,300 watts.

-   **Appearance**

Most blenders come with containers with materials like plastic, steel, and glass. Plastic and glass containers can easily break or get damaged. On the other hand, a steel jar blender usually is a safe bet.

Most glass containers are hardy and can easily maintain the weight of the blender stable. If you are grinding rough ingredients such as spices and nuts, the blender can become unstable.

Also, glass and steel jars keep the blender fixed on your kitchen countertop.

#### **Features of a Food Processor**

Some expensive food processors are polished with stainless steel. Durability and stylish design are the qualities that make stainless steel important. Also, the bowl features stainless steel, glass, or plastic construction.

Food processors are built with a range of sizes, and they have bowls that range from 3 to 15 cups and more. They significantly have feeding tubes that are used to add ingredients when the appliance is on properly.

-   **Power**

The optimal power of a food processor depends on the quantity of food being processed and the bowl capacity. Also, the time used in food processing will depend on power.

Compact food processors are designed to deliver approximately 300-400, the average class has about 400-600 watts, and the most potent models vary from 700 to 2000 W.

#### **Disadvantages of Using a Food Processor** 

Well, just like any other kitchen appliance, a food processor has its disadvantages. The machine doesn’t handle liquids properly.

Also, it leaves food chunks of vegetables and fruits that should be reprocessed. This is perhaps attributed to the construction design as your food will spin outwards, thus sticking to the container’s outer parts.

Some users also claim that the food processors’ buying process is quite tricky as they are available in numerous types and brands. Therefore, if you don’t know how to select a durable model for your kitchen, you’ll end up wasting your money.

Having known the basics of a blender and food processor in terms of their features, advantages, and disadvantages, let’s look at a significant difference between them.

## **Differences between a Food Processor and a Blender** 

**1\. The Shape** 

Blenders are jugs designed with a rotating blade located on the cone-shaped base. The blade and the base configuration allow the contents to naturally fall towards the center of the jar, forming a vortex in the middle of the jug.

On the other hand, food processors have a flat and large bowl with two blades with different heights. The bottom blade scrapes the base, whereas the higher blade chops contents from above.

Food processors are meant to pulverize solid food into tiny particles.

**2\. Functionality** 

Both appliances are essential in mixing dry and wet ingredients, but the shape of each appliance’s base shows the purpose for which each is designed as well as the task that each will execute flawlessly.

Therefore, a blender is constructed for use basically with liquid as it blends. Hence, it handles soups and smoothies well. 

Conversely, food processors have flat bowls making them perfect appliances for doughs and drier ingredients. It helps in processing food, removing most of the manual factors of prep tasks. Think to knead pizza dough, grating cheese, and whizzing up the pesto. 

**3\. Attachments**

A blender has only one set of blades and only one jug. But you can also get extra jars to deal with dry foods (with a different base shape to assist in processing dry foods).

On the other side, food processors are designed with a range of attachments like graters, dough blades, slicers, and many others. These attachments improve appliance usability, thus helping in the processing of large quantities of food quickly and straightforward.

**4\. The Size** 

Blenders come with a fixed size that’s always less than the desired size you might think of. In other words, they are designed in a small area.

Food processors feature a large capacity, and most of them have a variety of smaller blades and bowls. This helps in preparing smaller food batches easier, and you can prepare more than one food content between washes.

## **Differences between a Food Processor and a Blender – Bottom Line**

While a [food processor](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/kitchen-dining/small-appliances/) is a friendly appliance for bakers, a blender, on the other hand, is excellent for kitchen users who love liquid lunch (either smoothies or cocktails).
