## What are Lunch Coolers? 

Whenever you’re doing manual tasks, you will feel drained. There is no better feeling than being able to reach out and grab a bottle of your favorite cold drink.

Lunch coolers are built to enable you to achieve this. They are insulated and well-built to ensure that your drinks and food remain cold/warm for long, without going bad. 

The embedded insulation ensures optimum heat retention and freshness preservation, thus avoiding food poisoning cases. 

## Lunch Coolers Construction 

Lunch coolers have multi-layered insulations – an outer layer, a lining, the middle layer, and the inner layer. 

-   **Outer Layer.** This layer is made of rigid materials to enable the cooler lunchbox to withstand harsh environmental conditions that characterize construction sites. It is made of durable materials such as vinyl, polyester, and nylon. 
-   **Inner Layer.** This layer is designed using water-resistant materials to enable you to use ice in the box devoid of water seepage. It is made out of materials such as plastic, aluminum, and foil liners. This feature ensures that your food remains fresh and dry. 
-   **Middle Layer.** This layer contains an insulating foam, and it’s the primary determinant of your lunch cooler’s performance. The foam is made out of sturdy polyurethane, polyester fibers, or polyethylene plastic.

All three layers determine how durable your lunch cooler will be. If the exterior material is weak, then you can be sure that the box will not last for long when subjected to adverse conditions. The inner layer must be designed to prevent water from seeping to the outside. 

## How Lunch Coolers Works

The middle layer is primarily crucial as it is made of dense foam. The thicker it is, the better the insulation and the better the lunch cooler will be. 

The middle foam zone prevents heat from getting out of the box, thus keeping the inside warm or cold. If this layer functions optimally, you’ll realize that the lunch cooler bag’s outer layer cannot get hot even when you have hot food inside. The high-level insulation is what makes any lunch cooler box perform optimally. 

Additionally, the inner layer can reflect heat. It has a foil-like appearance that helps in retaining the food’s thermal energy. This feature ensures that no heat escapes from the bag, thus enabling your food to maintain its original temperature, moisture, and flavor.

The lunch coolers also prevent the food from going bad, regardless of the surrounding temperatures. This feature has earned these boxes a recommendation by the [US Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/08/13/use-insulated-lunch-bag-keep-meals-safe).

## How Effective are Insulated Lunch Cooler Bags

Are you wondering how long an insulated lunch bag can keep your food warm or cold? Well, there is no definite answer to this. 

How long your food remains fresh will depend on several factors, including the type of the bag, the surrounding temperature, and the presence/absence of heated/frozen gel.

If you do not add any gels, the food will still be fresh 2-3 hours if it’s hot and 4-5 hours if it is cold. An inclusion of frozen gel will add approximately 4 hours to this time.
