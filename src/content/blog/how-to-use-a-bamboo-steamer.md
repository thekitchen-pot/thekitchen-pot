## Bamboo Steamer Set Up 

A [bamboo steamer](https://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--37356/bamboo-steamer.asp) works by steaming your meals to unmatched doneness. The steamer is placed on top of a wok of simmering water.

As the water simmers, steam rises through the open ridges available on the bottom of each basket. It rises through the layers of the bamboo steamer, cooking everything that is inside the baskets. 

If you’re new to using the bamboo steamer, you should follow these steps for the best results:

-   **Fill the Trays/Baskets.** You should put all your ingredients in the available trays. Ensure that you add food with the same cooking time to each tray. The ones with a shorter cook time should be at the top. Once you’re done, you should cover the steamer using the lid.

***When cooking food that may leave an odor, such as fish, you should always line the bottom of the basket with banana leaves or a perforated parchment paper.*** 

Additionally, you should ensure that you space the food to prevent sticking and allow air circulation. 

-   **Prepare Your Wok.** You should fill your skillet/wok with approximately 3 inches of water. The water level should not exceed the rim of the bottom layer of the bamboo steamer. Once the water boils, you can reduce the heat to allow your food to simmer and slow cook. 

***Do not allow your food to be submerged in water***.

-   **Place Your Bamboo Steamer.** Once the water starts simmering, you should place your steamer in the skillet/ wok. Always keep checking the water level. If it reduces to a low level, add more to prevent your food from burning. 

## Advantages of a Bamboo Steamer 

-   **Lightweight.** When you compare this steamer with **[other cookware](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-waterless-cookware-reviews//)**, you’ll be amazed at how light it is! It is easy to handle the appliance even when it has food in it.
-   **It is Stackable.** Like we’ve earlier indicated, the bamboo steamer comes with many stackable baskets. This way, you can steam more than one food item simultaneously.
-   **Highly Aesthetic.** A bamboo steamer is natural and attractive. It oozes elegance and class, and you can be sure that it will be a mark of excellence in your kitchen.
-   **Easy to Use.** Cooking with a bamboo steamer requires little supervision. The risk of your food burning is minimal. All that you’ll be required to do is check the water levels regularly.
-   **Relatively Affordable.** Compared with stainless steel, copper, and other exotic cookware, buying a bamboo steamer is undoubtedly affordable. 

## What are the Disadvantages of Bamboo Steamer?

-   **Absorbs Odor.** Bamboo steamers absorb odor! When you’re cooking fish, you should line the basket with banana leaves to prevent odor retention. 
-   **Relatively Difficult to Clean.** Washing the steamer after cooking can be a hassle. It is challenging to get rid of any odor form (you can use lemon or tea bags to eliminate the odor).

## How to Clean Your Bamboo Steamer 

[Cleaning your bamboo steamer](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Bamboo-Steamer) is one of the essential maintenance tips. Ensure that you clean it thoroughly after every use. Follow these steps:

**Rinse the Steamer**

Immediately after you remove your food, you should rinse the steamer using warm water. This is particularly important if you’d used leaves or parchment paper when cooking.

If there are any remains of the leaves, then you should soak the basket in hot water for approximately 5 minutes, then rinse it. 

**Avoid Using a Dishwasher** 

Your bamboo steamer will serve you for a long if you hand wash it. Dishwashers are characterized by harsh detergents, which will undoubtedly reduce their lifespan.

**Wipe Away Any Food Remains with a Non-Abrasive Scrubber**

In case the rinsing did not remove all the dirt and food remains, you can use a scrubber/ a bristled scrub brush to get rid of them. However, it would be best if you were gentle throughout the entire process to avoid damaging the baskets. 

> ***Avoid dish soap as bamboo is porous and may soak the detergent leaving behind a residual smell that may be transferred to your next meal!***

**Use Tea Bag/ Lemon to Remove Odors** 

In case your bamboo basket has a residual smell, you can rub its side with lemon. Alternatively, you can soak a tea bag in warm water and rub it on the sides of the steamer.

These two methods will help resolve the odor menace in a few minutes!

**Oil Your Bamboo Steamer**

This is an optional step, but we highly recommend it. It prevents your steamer from cracking once it dries up. 

After you’re through cleaning and drying, you should dip a paper towel into the oil and spread it all over the bamboo steamer. Dry it and store it for the next assignment.
