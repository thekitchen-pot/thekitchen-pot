### **What You Should Consider When Shopping for the Best Wood Burning Stove**

**1\. Surface Area/ Size**

How big is your ideal wood stove? You definitely shouldn’t settle for an excessively large wood stove. However, this will largely be influenced by personal preferences and space availability.

If you believe that big is superb, and you have an adequate storage space, then you shouldn’t hesitate to buy that which satisfies all your needs holistically. 

**2\. Coverage**

-   **Self-Standing Stoves.** Most of the traditional stoves fall into this category. The fireboxes vary in size and do not use blowers. When using stoves with this design, you may require top ventilation. Their sturdy cast iron/steel construction makes them relatively heavy. 
-   **Modern Design.** These stoves use blowers, which makes them more energy-efficient than the traditional self-standing ones. They allow for both a back and top ventilation system and have a clear front-face to allow you to watch the fire flames from the firebox.

The best wood burning stoves will either have a glass or ceramic door. The glass doors offer better aesthetics since they allow you to see the flame as the wood burns. 

On the other hand, the ceramic doors are good conductors of heat. Consequently, they will play a crucial role in heating your house. 

**7\. Safety**

Before you settle for your best wood burning stove, you should ensure that it is certified. This is the only sure way to avoid counterfeit models, which may expose you to dangers. Always check the safety certificate from the manufacturer before you make a purchase!
