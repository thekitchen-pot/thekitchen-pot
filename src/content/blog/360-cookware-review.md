## Waterless Cooking – 360 Cookware Reviews

360 Cookware specializes in crafting cookware that promotes healthy cooking. All the 360 pans and pots are designed to allow waterless cooking.

So, what is waterless cooking?

This is a cooking technique that allows you to cook your meals without adding water. As such, the food will cook in its natural juice, thus ensuring that you lock in all the nutrients. 

Besides the nutritional value of waterless cooking, you will also get tastier meals.

## How 360 Waterless Cookware Works 

For waterless cooking to work, you have to use a pot that allows all the vapor to condense back to your meal. As such, the lids must be designed in a way that they will not allow the vapor to escape.

To achieve this, 360 cookware comes with unique lids with the following features:

-   **Vapor Seal Feature.** The lid has a vapor seal that enables the retention of heat and vapor. The heat then moves around the food creating a super hot and moist cooking environment. Consequently, the food will cook faster and you’ll require little to no water/oil. 
-   **Tight Fitting Lid.** The lids are designed to fit perfectly on the pots. This helps to complement the vapor seal in preventing vapor and heat loss. 

## Design and Construction of 360 Cookware

360 cookware uses surgical-grade stainless steel and aluminum material in pots and pans construction. The use of the three metal layers helps in boosting the performance of the pots. The structure of 360 cookware is as follows:

-   **Two layers of stainless steel encapsulate a layer of aluminum meta**l, which is ideal for heat conduction. 
-   The **inner layer is made of T-304 surgical-grade stainless steel**. This metal is non-porous and does not react with your food. As such, you can be sure of safety and food free from metallic taste. 
-   The **outer layer is made out of T-400 stainless steel**, which is mixed with nickel and carbon making it stronger, durable, and compatible with all stovetops, including induction cooktops. 

Additionally, 360 cookware uses [11-gauge metal](https://www.metalsupermarkets.com/sheet-metal-gauge-chart/) in all the construction work. This metal grade is thick enough to guarantee durability, superb heat retention, and adequate heat distribution. 

### Surgical-Grade Stainless Steel Construction -Why It is Important

Like we’ve earlier indicated, the interior layer of 360 cookware is made out of T-304 surgical-grade stainless steel. But why is this construction important?

Well, surgical grade stainless steel consists of a high level of nickel and chromium which makes it stronger than ordinary steel. 

Additionally, this construction improves the cookware’s resistance to corrosion, thus making the pans durable. The high-grade steel has a better temperature resistance, which transfers heat better, thus enabling you to use little to no fluids and retain natural flavor. 

Overall, surgical-grade stainless steel guarantees non-porosity, rust resistance, and corrosion resistance. These features make the safest and most effective material for making cookware. As such, you can be sure that 360 cookware is among the best pans in the market.
